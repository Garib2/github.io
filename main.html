<p class="example"> <em>An element</em> is a construct consisting of an opening tag, some optional attributes,
    some content, and a closing tag. Elements can contain any number of further elements,
    which are, in turn, made up of tags, attributes, and content. </p> <br>
<p class="example"> <em>A tag</em> indicates the start and end of an element. The opening tag can contain multiple
    attributes, but it cannot contain other elements or tags, while the closing tag cannot contain anything but itself. In the preceding example, there are four tags: an opening &lt;p&gt;, an
    opening &lt; em &gt;, a closing &lt; &#47; em &gt;, and a closing &lt; &#47; p &gt;. </p>
    <br>

<p class="example"> <em>Attributes</em> appear within tags, and they can only contain the value of the attribute, for
    instance: </p>
    <p class="example"> &lt; p class="example" &gt; >Here is some text, some of which is &lt; em &gt; emphasized &lt; &#47; em &gt; &lt; &#47; p &gt;</p>
    <p class="example"> This example shows the class attribute. An attribute can contain multiple, space-separated
        values, which is useful if you need to apply different classes to one element. For instance, if
        you have two styles, one named example and another named reference, you can apply
        them both to a paragraph like so: </p>
    <p class="example"> &lt; p class="example reference" &gt;</p>
    <br>
<p class="example"> <em> Divs and spans </em> are two tags that, when used well, can help give your page a logical structure
    and some extra hooks to apply any CSS or DOM scripting that you might need later. When
    used badly, they can litter your document unnecessarily and make your markup, styling, and
    scripting needlessly complicated. I cover these two tags again in more depth in Chapter 6,
    but in this section I simply outline the main differences between and uses of them. </p>
    <p class="example"> <em> A div </em> is used for marking out a block of content, such as the main
        content block of your document, the main navigation, the header, or the footer. As such,
        it is a block element. It can contain further elements, including more divs if required, but
        it cannot be contained within an inline element. For example, a simple website may have
        a header, a main column of content, a secondary column of content, and a footer.The (X)HTML for this could look like the following:</p>
    <p class="example"> &lt;div id="header"&gt; </p>
    <p class="example"> ... </p>
    <p class="example"> &lt;&#47;div&gt;</p>
    <p class="example"> These content blocks can then be positioned and displayed as required using CSS.</p>
    <p class="example"> <em> A span </em> is used for marking out sections within a block element and sometimes inside
        another inline element. It is an inline element, just the same as  &lt;em&gt;,  &lt;strong&gt;, and  &lt;a&gt;, except without any semantic meaning — it is simply a generic container. It can itself contain
        further inline elements, including more spans.  For example, say you wish to color the first
        two words of a paragraph red, keeping the rest of the paragraph black. You can use a span for this: </p>
        <p class="example"> &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="leadingWords"&gt;The first &lt;&#47;span&gt; two words of this paragraph can now be styled differently.&lt;&#47;p&gt; </p>
        <p class="example"> A span cannot contain a block element — that is, you cannot place a &lt;div&gt; within a &lt;span&gt; and expect it to work the way you want.</p>
